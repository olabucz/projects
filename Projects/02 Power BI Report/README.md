## Let me introduce you my **first** ever **Power BI Report** :bar_chart:. 

Created in October 2023. The dataset I worked with is a default and built-in Power BI _financials dataset_ :money_with_wings:.

At first, users can see a ![main view](https://github.com/olabucz/projects/tree/main/Projects/02%20Power%20BI%20Report/Images/01_main_view.png?raw=true).

There are three slicers to filter the data - by Product Name, Country and Industry Segment. Reported values and charts change depending on ![chosen slicers](https://github.com/olabucz/projects/tree/main/Projects/02%20Power%20BI%20Report/Images/05_filters_result.png?raw=true). There is a clear filter button to get back to all data view.
