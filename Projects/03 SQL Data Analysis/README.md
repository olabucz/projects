## Time for some SQL! :sparkles::sparkles:

My last project of year 2023. 

While working on it I had two things in mind: to gain knowledge of SQL queries + practice the language and to present acquired skills with more complex and insightful queries. 

In **OrdersDatasetAnalysis.pdf** you can find 10 queries (and their results) I chose. Showing the most was the key - not only basic grouping and filtering, but also joins, union, case-when. Besides, some usable insights :eye: have been obtained - as in proper data analysis :wink: .
