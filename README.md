## Hello world! :wave:

My name is Aleksandra and I am making my first steps into the wide and vibrant world of Data :climbing_woman: .<br>
I am a Technical Physics graduate and I work as a Junior Analyst. 

### projects - **free time/self-study projects** :chart_with_upwards_trend: and **publications** :microscope:

In Projects directory you can view projects I do in my free time with the aim of self-study and skills development. 
In Publications directory, there are scientific articles which I co-authored during my university and post-university time.

And there will only be more! :v: :monocle_face:
